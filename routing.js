St. Petersburg College allows its employee to set up automatic deposit from their
job. As such, the employee needs to specify the routing number for their bank. In
order to make sure the money gets routed correctly, SPC wants to validate that
the employee enters a valid routing number. The list of valid routing numbers is
below.
